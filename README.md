# Challenge-Password Generator

## Description
The Challenge-Password Generator is a powerful tool designed to generate secure passwords based on specific criteria. With this generator, users can create passwords ranging from 8 to 128 characters in length. To ensure strong password strength, the generator allows users to include at least one of the following four types of data: lowercase alphabetic characters, uppercase alphabetic characters, numbers, or special characters.

Users can generate passwords as many times as needed, providing them with flexibility and convenience. In case of invalid input, the generator provides warnings to alert users and prohibits password generation until valid criteria are met. This ensures that all generated passwords meet the specified security requirements.

By using the Challenge-Password Generator, users can easily obtain highly secure and customizable passwords that are resistant to common hacking techniques.
